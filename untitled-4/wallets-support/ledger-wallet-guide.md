> Please Note: When using a Ledger to secure your Binance Chain wallet, your private keys are not exposed and never leave the device, guarding you against loss, malware and phishing attacks. Therefore, using a hardware wallet device such as the Ledger Nano S is strongly recommended over using a less secure wallet storage method that relies on your computerâ€™s local storage, such as Keystore File.
