# Learn‑to‑Win (L2W)

## Architecture and Flow

Version: 1.0.0\
Solidity: ^0.8.20

### Goal

L2W incentivizes user learning/participation with Neurons rewards, using PoK as the proof foundation.

### Components

* L2W App/Platform (off‑chain)
  * Learning experiences, challenges, quizzes, AI tasks
  * Orchestrator that computes the reward and prepares the `proof` (EIP‑712) for PoK
* `PoKMinter` + `ECDSAVerifier` (on‑chain)
  * Proof validation and token issuance
* `Neurons` token
  * Receives mints from PoK, controls cap/pause/roles
* (Optional) `NeuronsOFTAdapter` bridge for multi‑chain

### User flow

1. User completes activities on the platform
2. Backend computes reward and generates EIP‑712 message with `(recipient, amount, nonce, expiry)`
3. Backend signs with `trustedSigner` and sends the `proof` to the contract via frontend/API
4. `PoKMinter.mintWithProof(...)` validates limits and calls `token.mint`
5. User receives Neurons as a reward

### Reward model (examples)

* Based on difficulty and time (more complex tasks are worth more)
* Level progression (higher rewards for streak/consistency)
* Event and curation bonuses (e.g., vetted content)

### Controls and limits

* `minCooldown`: reduces continuous farming per account
* `maxDailyMint`: caps daily issuance per user
* `maxSingleMint`: prevents anomalous per-proof values
* KYC/anti‑spam policies can complement (off‑chain)

### Wallet/signature integration

* `ECDSAVerifier` uses domain `NeuronsPoK` v1 and EIP‑712
* `buildMessageHash(...)` facilitates SDK reuse

### Metrics and telemetry

* On‑chain: `totalMintsProcessed`, `totalTokensMinted`
* Off‑chain: course completion, quiz accuracy, task weights
* Dashboards: daily issuance, unique users, proof approval rate

### Security

* Rotate `trustedSigner` and protect the private key
* Monitor `nonce` to avoid replay; expire proofs
* Observability on success/failure rates by source
* Use `pause()` when needed

### Multi‑chain (optional)

* `NeuronsOFTAdapter` (LayerZero) enables moving balances across chains:
  * Burn/mint mode (preferred): burn on source, mint on destination
  * Lock/unlock mode: lock on source, release on destination
* Controlled by `trustedRemote` and `remoteChainAllowed` whitelist

### Roadmap

* Support for alternative verifiers (zk, oracles)
* User reputation and trust levels
* Collaborative missions and reward pools
