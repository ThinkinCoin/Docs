# Architecture

Our system architecture is designed to support the delivery of educational content, community engagement, and the meme token creation service. It consists of hardware and software components that work together to provide a seamless user experience.

#### Hardware Components

Web Servers: These servers host the project's website, educational content, and community features. They handle user requests, deliver web pages, and manage user interactions.

Database Servers: Database servers store user data, course materials, blockchain information, and policy updates. They ensure data availability and integrity.

Cloud Services: The project may utilize cloud-based services for scalability, redundancy, and data backup.

Load Balancers: Load balancers distribute incoming web traffic across multiple web servers to ensure performance and availability.

#### Software Components

Web Application: The core of the system, this includes the educational platform, community engagement features, and meme token creation service. It is built using web development technologies and frameworks.

Content Management System (CMS): The CMS manages and organizes educational content, making it accessible to users. It supports content creation, updates, and user progress tracking.

Database Management System (DBMS): A DBMS (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) handles data storage and retrieval. It ensures that user profiles, course progress, blockchain data, and policy information are stored securely.

Blockchain Data API: This component interacts with various blockchain networks to retrieve real-time data and updates. It provides accurate and up-to-date information about blockchains.

User Authentication and Authorization: A robust authentication system verifies user identities and manages access to different parts of the platform. It ensures user data security.

Meme Token Creation Module: This module facilitates meme token creation, allowing users to customize token attributes and launch tokens. It includes security features to prevent misuse.

Community Engagement Features: These features include forums, chat, and discussion boards. They are integrated into the platform to foster user interactions and knowledge sharing.
