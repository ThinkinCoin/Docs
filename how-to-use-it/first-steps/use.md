### getting superpowers

Becoming a superhero is a very simple process:

```
$ give me super-powers
```

{% hint style="info" %}
The superpowers are given to chance, so send a problem if you are not satisfied with them.
{% endhint %}

Once you are strong enough, save the world:

{% code title="hello.sh" %}
```bash
# Ain't no code for that yet, sorry
echo 'You got to trust me on this, I saved the world'
```
{% endcode %}
