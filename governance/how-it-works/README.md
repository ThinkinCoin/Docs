Learn about Decision-Making and Communication among the Stakeholders of MakerDAO

Get Started With Governance

MakerDAO governance describes the way rules, norms, and actions are structured, sustained, regulated, and upheld.

Governance involves processes conducted both on-chain and off-chain.

On-Chain Governance

On-chain governance refers to Governance Polls and Executive Votes. Anyone who owns MKR can participate in these votes.

## Maker \(MKR\) Token <a id="maker-mkr-token"></a>

Maker \(MKR\) token holders are the primary stakeholders of the system and vote using the Maker Protocol's on-chain governance system.

## Governance Polls <a id="governance-polls"></a>

Governance Polls establish a soft consensus and measure community sentiment, through time-based voting.

Off-Chain Governance

Off-chain governance refers to processes for making decisions that don't require on-chain voting and gathering feedback prior to on-chain voting. Anyone can participate in off-chain governance.
