# Immunefi Bug Bounty

Bounties are an important tool for testing and enhancing application and contract security. We appreciate the skilled hackers and programmers within the community and believe in rewarding those working to protect and strengthen the ecosystem. Working in partnership with [Immunefi](https://immunefi.com/), we will be releasing additional bounties in the near future, and invite the community to help identify any possible exploits we may have missed.

Security is the \#1 priority of the xDai team. This bounty program is not being enacted in response to any know exploits, we are proactively implementing to ensure safety and soundness of our applications and protect xDai users and their funds.

### **The largest bug bounty program offered through Immunefi to date!** <a id="the-largest-bug-bounty-program-offered-through-immunefi-to-date"></a>

Bounties are based on severity of bug found and range from $1,000 to $2,000,000. For more, please visit the bounty page at [https://immunefi.com/bounty/xdaistake/](https://immunefi.com/bounty/xdaistake/) read the rules and get started.

Bridges connecting xDai with Ethereum, BSC and other future chains are critical infrastructure. They are designed to hold many millions of dollars worth of assets, and as such are a tantalizing target for bad actors. In addition to thorough security audits for the OmniBridge architecture, we are collaborating with [Immunefi](https://immunefi.com/) to offer up to $2,000,000 for the discovery of bugs or exploits that may result in a loss of user funds related to the OmniBridge.
