# Proof of Stake

## What is staking? <a id="what-is-staking"></a>

Staking is the process of **securing the network via locking up your tokens**. It serves the same purpose as mining in a Proof-of-Work network such as Bitcoin.

Validator nodes validate transactions and the staked tokens act as an **economic incentive** for stakers to play by the rules of the protocol.

Since validators are anonymous to make the network decentralized and resilient to attacks from the outside, Fantom employs **Proof-of-Stake** to prevent sybil attacks. A **sybil attack** is an attack, where a malicious actor runs a large number of validators to allow them an unsafe amount of influence over the network. Proof-of-Stake makes it costly to set up validators and allows the network to punish validators for malicious behavior, **increasing the costs of attacks**.

Fantom requires validator nodes to lock-up at least 1,000,000 FTM \(Fantom's native token\) to prevent sybil attacks.
