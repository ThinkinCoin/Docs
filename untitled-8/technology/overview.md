# Overview

Fantom is a high-performance, scalable, customizable, and secure **smart-contract platform**.

The platform is designed as a next generation of blockchain platform to address several limitations of existing blockchain platforms. Fantom is **permissionless, decentralized,** and **open-source**.

Lachesis, a revolutionary [**aBFT consensus protocol**](lachesis-abft.md)**,** has made Fantom to be much faster and cheaper than previous technologies, yet extremely secure.

Fantom is **customizable**. Multiple blockchains can all be plugged into Lachesis and they can easily communicate. Each blockchain works independently from one another, and each of them can have its own custom tokens, tokenomics, and governance rules.

Fantom is **modular**. Lachesis is fully compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine \(EVM\) and it can be integrated with the Cosmos SDK.
