# Tokenomics

## Technical Specification

Version: 1.0.0\
Solidity: ^0.8.20 (OpenZeppelin v5)

### Overview

Neurons is an ERC‑20 token with:

* A fixed max supply cap of 10,000,000 NEURONS
* Minting gated by roles (MINTER\_ROLE)
* Burn (self-burn) and burnFrom (allowed for BURNER\_ROLE)
* Pausability (ERC20Pausable) to halt transfers/mints/burns during incidents
* Permit (EIP‑2612) support via ERC20Permit
* Integration with external systems: PoK and bridge (LayerZero OFT Adapter)

Contract: `contracts/src/tokens/Neurons.sol`

### Interfaces and inheritance

* OpenZeppelin v5:
  * `ERC20`
  * `ERC20Capped`
  * `ERC20Permit`
  * `ERC20Pausable`
  * `Ownable`
  * `AccessControl`
* Internal library: `Errors.sol`

### Constants and roles

* `MAX_SUPPLY = 10_000_000 ether`
* `MINTER_ROLE = keccak256("MINTER_ROLE")`
* `BURNER_ROLE = keccak256("BURNER_ROLE")`

### Events

* `MinterUpdated(address minter, bool allowed)`
* `BurnerUpdated(address burner, bool allowed)`
* `TokensMinted(address to, uint256 amount, address minter)`
* `TokensBurned(address from, uint256 amount, address burner)`

### Relevant errors (Errors.sol)

* `ZeroAddress()`
* `InvalidAmount()`
* `CapExceeded()` (in batch mint when the sum exceeds the cap)
* `ArrayLengthMismatch()`

### Functions — Neurons contract

Administration (owner):

* `setMinter(address minter, bool allowed)`
* `setBurner(address burner, bool allowed)`
* `pause()` / `unpause()`

Mint/Burn:

* `mint(address to, uint256 amount)` — requires `MINTER_ROLE`
* `batchMint(address[] recipients, uint256[] amounts)` — requires `MINTER_ROLE`
* `burn(uint256 amount)` — burns from `msg.sender`
* `burnFrom(address account, uint256 amount)` — requires `BURNER_ROLE`

View:

* `remainingSupply() -> uint256`
* `isMinter(address) -> bool`
* `isBurner(address) -> bool`

Permit (EIP‑2612):

* Inherited from `ERC20Permit` (name: "Neurons")
* `permit(owner, spender, value, deadline, v, r, s)`
* `nonces(owner)` and `DOMAIN_SEPARATOR()`

Internal overrides:

* `_update` (OZ v5): `override(ERC20, ERC20Pausable, ERC20Capped)` — keeps cap/pause logic centralized in `_update`.

### Usage flows

* Mint is controlled by orchestrators (e.g., `PoKMinter`) having `MINTER_ROLE`.
* Burn to reduce a user balance or operationally via `BURNER_ROLE` (e.g., bridge adapter in burn/mint mode).
* Pause for incident response; pauses block transfer/mint/burn.
* Permit for off-chain signed approvals.

### Security considerations

* Only the `owner` manages minter/burner roles.
* Avoid granting `MINTER_ROLE` to more entities than necessary.
* Audit `TokensMinted/TokensBurned` events for traceability.
* Pause as an emergency mechanism.

### Integrations

* `PoKMinter` calls `mint()`; it must hold `MINTER_ROLE`.
* `NeuronsOFTAdapter` may call `burnFrom()` and `mint()` on the destination; ensure `BURNER_ROLE`/`MINTER_ROLE` according to the bridge mode.
