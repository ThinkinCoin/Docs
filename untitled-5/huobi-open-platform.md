# Huobi Open Platform

The Huobi Open Platform is a unified infrastructure platform based on the technical, traffic and ecological resources of the Huobi Group, and will be gradually open to the blockchain industry. It will make the construction of decentralized applications more efficient and cost-effective, and provide comprehensive empowerment in aspects of promotion, traffic, and resources. In December 2020, the first product of the Huobi Open Platform, the Huobi ECO Chain, also known as Heco, officially launched its "Tinder" phase. In addition, Huobi Open Platform will launch DEX and other blockchain infrastructures based on Layer 2. The Huobi Open Platform will provide global developers with series of diverse innovative facilities and services.

## Huobi ECO Chain <a id="huobi-eco-chain"></a>

Huobi ECO Chain \(Heco\) is a decentralized, high-efficiency and energy-saving public chain, also the first product launched by the Huobi Open Platform. It is compatible with smart contracts and supports high-performance transactions. The endogenous token of Heco is HT and it adopts the HPoS consensus mechanism. Heco will continue to improve the efficiency of Ethereum by Layer2, which will supplement and empower the Ethereum ecosystem.

To help developers’ evolvement at every stage

Heco's mission is not only a public chain, but also to focus on the discovery and support of high-potential developers and innovative projects. Relying on the world's largest trading ecosystem, Heco is committed to becoming the birthplace of innovative technologies and innovative businesses, and building a complete ecological loop of technology development, application promotion, and trading.

* TPS: 500+
* Average block interval: 3s

HPoS consensus mechanism: it has the characteristics of low transaction cost, low transaction delay, and high transaction concurrency.

The maximum number of validators supported is 21.

The endogenous token on the chain is HT; the transactions consume HT as gas fee.

Miners pledge HT to become validator nodes. The reward of nodes is gas fee, which is distributed according to the mortgage proportion.

Assets such as BTC, ETH and stable coins can be mapped to Heco by an asset bridge. The realization method is to lock a certain amount of tokens on the original chain then generate a corresponding number of tokens on Heco.

Heco encourages developers to provide more decentralized cross-chain solution.

The meta-transaction function is supported, which allows users to reduce gas fees step-wise, and Heco will cover the payment of the reduced part. The meta-transaction function allows to minimize the migration cost of DApp developers, as well as to effectively reduce the cost of DApp users.

* An open and decentralized network to maintain the security of the network and assets.
* Support the programmability of EVM, the compatibility of smart contracts to reduce development or migration costs.
* Meta-transaction function: gas fee reduction, effectively reducing the cost of developers and users on the chain.
* Support cross-chain asset transfer to optimize users’ experience.

In December 2020, the Huobi Eco chain, Heco officially launched its "Tinder" phase, which will focus on improving the on-chain infrastructure, including but not limited to: Oracles, Voting tools, Anchor Coins, DEX, Lending, Fnancial Management, Insurance, Synthetic Assets, Cross-Chain Solutions, Data Analysis, Smart Contract Innovation, etc.

* Heco will set up a special fund to invest, support and incentivize high-potential developers.
* Heco will launch a variety of developer activities and competitions to discover and fund potential developers.
* In order to reduce the cost of users on Heco Dapp, the Heco meta transaction function will reduce the gas fee of users holding HT in a step-wise manner.

Huobi Global will strongly support the development of Heco ecosystem:

* Provide traffic entrance for high-quality Dapp on Heco.
* After running successfully on Heco, high-quality projects can submit token listing application to Huobi Global, and can be listed on Huobi Global if they meet the listing standards.
* Projects or developers that have received investment and support from Heco have not only the opportunity to get official news report, but also can apply for marketing service packages and promote their projects globally.
* High-quality projects can participate in Heco global roadshows for free.
* Huobi Group will open up ecological resources to high-potential developers, matching the win-win cooperation between developers and our ecological partners.

* All users and developers can participate in the current test environment and subsequent stages of Heco for free, and there is no charging scenario.
* All users must distinguish the test environment from the Mainnet. The assets generated in the test environment have no value. Be aware of counterfeit currency fraud.
* Heco announces authorization, promotion and other collaborations only through the official social media platform. Developers and users should check carefully to avoid losses.
* Do not misread the official website \(hecochain.com\), and be cautious with private key phishing.
