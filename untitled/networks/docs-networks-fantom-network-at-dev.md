## What is Fantom?

​[Fantom](https://fantom.foundation/) is a fast, scalable, and secure layer-1 platform built on an aBFT consensus protocol.

Fantom is:

* permissionless
* decentralized
* open-source

​[Lachesis](https://github.com/ThinkinCoin/Docs/blob/dev/networks/fantom-network/technology/lachesis-abft.md), its revolutionary aBFT consensus mechanism, allows Fantom to be much faster and cheaper than previous technologies, yet extremely secure.

## Key features

### Speed

Fantom achieves transactions finality in ~1-2 seconds.

### Scalability

Fantom can process thousands of transactions per seconds and can scale to hundreds of nodes.

### Security

Lachesis provides institutional-grade security to distributed networks. Fantom offers absolute finality, which means that transactions can never be reverted like in networks with probabilistic finality. Fantom is also leaderless. By removing leaders, security doesn’t rely on a small set of actors.

### Smart contract support

Fantom is fully compatible with Ethereum. Developers can create and deploy smart contracts as they would on Ethereum.

### Consensus-as-a-service

Lachesis can be used to create any kind of private and public distributed ledger, using EVM or Cosmos SDK.
