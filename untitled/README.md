# Harmony ONE

Welcome to the Harmony Docs. This central resource contains an introduction to Harmony, our features and rationale, and resources for developers and network participants. It is divided in three main sections:

* **🎶** General - we describe the basics of Harmony and cover the technical features and our ecosystem, including grants and showcases.
* **🏗️** Developers - we share all the tools and documentation for developers to deploy smart contracts and build applications on Harmony.
* **🌏** Network - we provide guides for participating in the Harmony network as a validator, delegator and token holder.
