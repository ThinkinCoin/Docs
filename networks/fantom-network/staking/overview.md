# Overview

Fantom uses a **Fluid Staking** model where stakers select a lockup period between 0 to 365 days. The rewards percentage increases linearly with time, rewarding the most committed stakers more. This way, the reward schedule combines long-term sustainability for the network and flexibility for stakers. It was voted for by FTM holders in July 2020.

## Rewards <a id="rewards"></a>

In the Fluid Staking model, your effective APY:

* increases proportionally with your lock-up period
* decreases proportionally with the average lock-up period of all stakers
* decreases proportionally with the total amount of FTM staked by all stakers
