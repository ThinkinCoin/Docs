# Deploy a Smart Contract

Fantom utilizes the Ethereum Virtual Machine \(EVM\) in the backend. Smart contracts are written in Solidity and they can function on Fantom as they do on Ethereum.

To deploy a smart contract, you send a Fantom transaction containing your bytecode without specifying any recipients.

After the contract is deployed, it will be available to all users of the Fantom network. Smart contracts have a Fantom address like other accounts.

## **Requirements** <a id="requirements"></a>

* Bytecode \(compiled code\) of your smart contract
* FTM for gas costs
* Deployment script/plugin
* Access to a Fantom node, either by running your own node or API access to a node.
