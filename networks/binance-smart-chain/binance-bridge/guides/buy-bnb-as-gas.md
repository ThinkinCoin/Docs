The network fee should be the sum of the fee for swapping assets and the fee for purchasing BNB on your behalf.

The network fees are floating, you might get a different rate than you expected when your order is completed.

The actual amount of network fee you have to pay is _**network fee\*\(1-discount\)**_**.** When the discount is 100%, the network fee is free.
