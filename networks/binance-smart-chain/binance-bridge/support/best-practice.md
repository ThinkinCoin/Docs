# Best Practice

Please try a small amount before swap a large amount.

1. If your deposit transaction is sent shortly before the closing deadline, there is a great chance that the transaction will not be confirmed before closing time.
2. The deposit address will be allocated for every swap, please don’t reuse it in the future.
3. If your deposit was already closed, please don’t transfer any tokens.
4. If your deposit transaction value is not enough, you cannot complete your deposit with multiple transactions. Please wait for this swap to expire, and start a new one
