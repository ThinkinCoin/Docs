# Governance

### Motivation <a id="motivation"></a>

There are many system parameters to control the behavior of the BSC:

* All these parameters of BSC system contracts should be flexible: slashing threshold, cross-chain transfer fees, relayer reward amount and so on.
* params of Staking/Slash/Oracle modules on BC

All these parameters will be determined by BSC Validator Set together through a proposal-vote process based on their staking. Such the process will be carried on BC, and the new parameter values will be picked up by corresponding system contracts via cross-chain communication if needed.

### Design Principles <a id="design-principles"></a>

**For BC:**

* Codebase reuse: Reuse most of the structure of proposal and vote, and the logic about propose and vote.
* Cross chain package Available at once: The cross-chain package should be available once the proposal passed.
* Native params change take place at breath block: The param change of Staking/Slash/Oracle modules on BC take place at breath block after the proposal passed.

**For BSC:**

* Uniform interface. The contracts who are interested in these parameters only need to implement the same interface.
* Extensible. When adding a new system contract, there is no need to modify any other contracts.
* Failure toleration. Validators could vote to skip false proposals and go on.
* Multiplexing. Now we have only parameters gov, but in the future, there will be more governance functions.

### Contract Interface <a id="contract-interface"></a>

Every contract that wants to subscribe param change event, should implement the following interface: **function updateParam\(string key, bytes calldata value\) external**

Some following check must be done inside the interface:

* The msg sender must be the gov contract.
* Basic check of value. \(length, value range\)

An example implementation:

```text
modifier onlyGov() {
    require(msg.sender == GOV_CONTRACT_ADDR, "the msg sender must be the gov contract");
    _;
}

function updateParam(string key, bytes calldata value) external onlyGov{
    if (key == "relayerReward"){
        require(value.length == 32, "the length of value is not 32 when update relayer_reward param");
        uint256 memory paramValue = TypesToBytes.ToUint256(0, value);
        require(paramValue >= MIN_RELAYER_REWARD, "the relayerReward is smaller than the minimum value");
        require(paramValue <= MAX_RELAYER_REWARD, "the relayerReward is bigger than the maximal value");
        relayerReward = paramValueï¼›
    }else{
        require(false, "receive unknown param");
    }
}
```

### Gov Contract <a id="gov-contract"></a>

Implement the cross chain contract interface: **handlePackage\(bytes calldata msgBytes, bytes calldata proof, uint64 height, uint64 packageSequence\)**

And do following step: - Basic check. Sequence check, Relayer sender check, block header sync check, merkel proof check. - Check the msg type according to the first byte of msgBytes, only param change msg type supported for now. Check and parse the msg bytes. - Use a fixed gas to invoke the updateParam interface of target contract. Catch any exception and emit fail event if necessary, but let the process go on. - Claim reward for the relayer and increase sequence.
