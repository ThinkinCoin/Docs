Note: 9999 TRX will be paid when users apply to be an SR candidate.

Tronscan provides a way for Super Representatives to publish their information right where the voters are, on Tronscan!

Super Representatives can use this template to build a static page which will be shown on Tronscan. The link will be placed in the voting overview page right next to the name of SR.

The Super Representatives can manage their content by editing files in the Github repository.

**This guide assumes that you already have an account with Super Representative \(candidate\) status.**

1. Copy/Fork the Template on Github
2. Go to [https://github.com/tronscan/tronsr-template](https://github.com/tronscan/tronsr-template)
3. Fork the repository ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tronscan/docs/master/images/fork-repo.png)![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tronscan/docs/master/images/fork-repo.png)

After forking the repository, you will be navigated to your own `tronsr-template` version of the repository where you can make changes.

## Voting

Every account in TRONâ€™s network can vote for the Super Representatives they support. Voting requires TRON Power \(TP\), 1 TP = 1 frozen TRX.

Users can use Tronscan or Tronlink to freeze, vote or obtain reward.

* e.g.

```text
freezebalance password 10,000,000 3    // 10 TP for 10 frozen TRX
votewitness password witness1 4 witness2 6    //4 votes for witness1 and 6 votes for witness2
votewitness password witness1 3 witness2 7    // 3 votes for witness1 and 7 votes for witness2
```

The final result of the above commands is three votes for witness1 and seven votes for witness2.

## Freezing/Unfreezing Balance

### Why are Tokens Frozen?

The balance freezing mechanism is set up out of two considerations:

* To prevent malicious spam transactions from clogging the network and causing delayed transaction confirmation.
* To prevent malicious voting.

### Freeze/Unfreeze Mechanism

Once the balance is frozen, the user will receive a proportionate amount of TP and bandwidth. TP represents voting power, whereas bandwidth points are used to pay for transactions.

Frozen assets are held in your frozen account and cannot be used for trading.

The fixed frozen duration is three days, after which you can unfreeze your balance any time you like manually. Balance unfrozen will be transferred back into your current account.

* The freezing command is as follows:

```text
freezebalance password amount time
amount: the unit of frozen balance is Sun. The minimum frozen balance is 1,000,000 Sun or 1 TRX.
time: frozen duration lasting from date of freeze and date to unfreeze is three days.
```

* e.g.

  `freezebalance password 10_000_000 3`

* Unfreezing command:

  `unfreezebalance password`
