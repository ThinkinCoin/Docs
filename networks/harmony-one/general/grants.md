# Grants

Harmony Grants are to drive our platform’s mainnet utility, decentralized community, and cryptographic innovations — aligned with our 2020 roadmap on cross-border finance and auditable privacy.

The details of the program are highlighted in this [blog post](https://medium.com/harmony-one/harmony-grant-guideline-58ff9cec02a6).

## Grants Process <a id="grants-process"></a>

A prospective grantee starts an application by filling out the grant application.

**Apply at** [**harmony.one/grant-form**](https://harmony.one/grant-form) **today!**

Our team will reach out to the grantee shortly after and complete a full review of the proposal within a week. A typical grant process will look like this:

1. We review the application and refines metrics and deliverables together with the grantees.
2. Grantees and Harmony team recruits 6 governors to strongly support the grant.
3. Projects are posted publicly on [harmony.one/grant-forum](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://harmony.one/grant-forum&sa=D&ust=1600038161057000&usg=AFQjCNH2HIbwE-w86cJ3QhY2yERpdPXgzQ) and on [harmony.one/open-grants](https://harmony.one/open-grants). Governors confirms their support publicly on the forum.
4. Grantees carefully review the full guidelines on [harmony.one/grant-guidelines](https://harmony.one/grant-guidelines) to align expectations on milestones and funding.
5. Grantees are notified by Friday and start their projects the following Monday.

We engage publicly on the open Telegram channel [harmony.one/grant-telegram](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://harmony.one/grant-telegram&sa=D&ust=1600038161057000&usg=AFQjCNHv9mVpQ7SBQc_LUy7mMQ6wv_Bk6g) and on email at [\[email protected\]](https://docs.harmony.one/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)

We started giving out the first grant in July 2020 and have given 13 grants as of December 2020.

Going forward, we have learned to be as specific as possible setting grant deliverables and metrics upfront with each grantee. We'll be clearly setting expectations with governors \([below](https://docs.harmony.one/home/partners/grants-and-requests#grant-governors)\) and streamline the approval process to maximize Harmony Foundation's 154 million monthly token allocation.
