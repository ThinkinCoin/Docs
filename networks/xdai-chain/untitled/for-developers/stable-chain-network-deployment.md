## Stable Chain Network Deployment

Instructions for deploying an xDai-like network on AWS

**Stable Chain Deployment Instructions \(AWS\)**

These advanced instructions are for developers interested in deploying their own xDai-like \(or other ERC20 Stable Token\) Network. They are not required to run or interact with the xDai Stable Chain. This process is a bit involved, so grab a ☕ and settle in!

If you experience issues during installation, feel free to contact us on the [POA support forum](https://forum.poa.network/c/support/6).
