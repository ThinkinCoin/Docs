## JSON RPC endpoints <a id="json-rpc-endpoints"></a>

Main RPC is a load balancer with 4 nodes, health checks, and failover.

### **Additional resources to connect to xDai network** <a id="additional-resources-to-connect-to-xdai-network"></a>

üöÄ **QuikNode** also supports xDai. Devs can get their own custom endpoint for DApps or other needs. [https://blog.quiknode.io/xdai-network-is-live-on-quiknode/](https://blog.quicknode.com/xdai-network-is-live-on-quiknode/)‚Äã

‚Äã‚öì **Ankr** offers API endpoint access available with a free tier up to 100K requests/day. Additional paid tiers are available for developers. [https://www.ankr.com/](https://www.ankr.com/)‚Äã

‚Äã‚èπ **GetBlock.io** provides fast and easy API connection services to an xDai archive node. Both free and paid levels available. [https://getblock.io/nodes/stake](https://getblock.io/nodes/stake)‚Äã

‚Äãüåé **AnyBlock Analytics** provides a JSON-RPC professional service for users. As xDai validators, they have a deep understanding of the network as well as the broader Ethereum ecosystem. [https://www.anyblockanalytics.com/json-rpc](https://www.anyblockanalytics.com/json-rpc/?utm_source=xDAI&utm_medium=Organic-Social&utm_campaign=forum)‚Äã

### JSON-RPC Method Info <a id="json-rpc-method-info"></a>

If using `eth_getLogs`to pull logs frequently WebSockets are recommended to push new logs as available.

## POSDAO Contracts <a id="posdao-contracts"></a>

POSDAO consensus is implemented in Solidity. Proxy contracts should be read for values such as [Random Numbers](on-chain-random-numbers.md) generated by the protocol. A list of current contracts is [available here](https://github.com/poanetwork/poa-chain-spec/blob/dai/contracts.json#L9).

## TokenBridge <a id="tokenbridge"></a>

There are two bridge implementations connecting xDai and the Ethereum Mainnet.

\*\*\*\*[**xDai Bridge**](https://docs.tokenbridge.net/xdai-bridge/about): ERC20-to-Native TokenBridge implementation, used for transferring Dai &lt;-&gt; xDai between Ethereum and the xDai chain.

\*\*\*\*[**ETH-xDai Arbitrary Message Bridge**](https://docs.tokenbridge.net/eth-xdai-amb-bridge/about-the-eth-xdai-amb): AMB between Ethereum and xDai for data, token and message transfers. Includes the Ominibridge application for transfer of any ERC20 cross-chain.
