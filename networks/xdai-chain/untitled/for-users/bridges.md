# Bridges

* ​[xDai Bridge](https://www.xdaichain.com/for-users/bridges/converting-xdai-via-bridge): Bridge from Ethereum to the xDai network designed for the xDai native token. Convert Dai to xDai and bridge xDai to Dai on Ethereum.
* ​[Omnibridge](https://www.xdaichain.com/for-users/bridges/omnibridge): Bridge ERC20 tokens between Ethereum and xDai. OmniBridge is also available fro bridging between [Binance Smart Chain and xDai](https://www.xdaichain.com/for-users/bridges/omnibridge/binance-smart-chain-omnibridge).

## Multiple Token Instances <a id="multiple-token-instances"></a>

With multi-chain bridging, there is a possibility that multiple instances of an underlying asset can be created on a single chain.

For example, USDT can be bridged to xDai from Ethereum and also bridged to xDai from BSC. This results in 2 separate USDT token instances on xDai. These tokens cannot be merged into a single instance once they are minted.

A suffix is added to the token name in BlockScout, specifying the origin chain of a bridged token \(ie. from Ethereum, from BSC etc\). Tags indicate a token is bridged, and which chain the token is bridged from. Users can click View Original Token to view the token on the chain of origin.
