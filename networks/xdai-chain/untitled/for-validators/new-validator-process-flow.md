# New Validator Process Flow

## New Validator Process Flow

To become a new validator, candidates must complete a series of steps.

New Validator candidates should [follow the process outlined here](https://www.xdaichain.com/for-stakers/staking-protocol/become-a-candidate-validator). You will need the minimum amount of STAKE as well as a working node configured with your mining address.

You can choose to run either a Nethermind or OpenEthereum client. The [Nethermind](https://www.xdaichain.com/for-validators/new-validator-process-flow/nethermind-node-setup) implementation is still considered in Beta, [Open Ethereum](https://www.xdaichain.com/for-developers/install-xdai-client/parity) is recommended for first time validators.
